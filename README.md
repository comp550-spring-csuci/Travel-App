# WNDR
A full-stack application designed for travelers who want to document their trips, view their path on the globe, and share with others.

## Why we built this
The purpose for our app is to provide a visualization of a userâ€™s travel experiences. By posting about their trip and location, the app's globe will populate with all of their experiences. This app is for anyone interested in documenting their travels and sharing it with others.
